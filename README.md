# 🎲 Dice Roll Simulator: Probability in Action  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Dice Roll Simulator** is a Java-based program that simulates rolling two dice **100 times** and records the frequency of specific sums. It provides insight into probability distributions by counting occurrences of sums like **2, 4, 6, and 7**.

## ⚡ Features  
🎯 **Realistic Dice Rolls** – Uses a `Dice` class to generate random dice rolls 🎲  
📊 **Statistical Tracking** – Counts occurrences of sums for **2, 4, 6, and 7** 📈  
🔄 **100-Roll Loop** – Automates dice rolling to simulate multiple outcomes ♻️  
🖨️ **Formatted Output** – Displays each roll and final statistics clearly 📝

## 🏗️ How It Works  
1. 🎲 The program **creates a new dice instance** and initializes counters.  
2. 🔁 It loops **100 times**, rolling **two dice per iteration** and calculating their sum.  
3. 📊 If the sum is **2, 4, 6, or 7**, the corresponding counter **increments**.  
4. 📝 Each roll result is **printed to the console**.  
5. 📈 After 100 rolls, the program **displays final statistics**, showing how often each tracked sum appeared.

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. **Run the program** in a Java-supported environment 🖥️  
2. **Observe the rolls and sums** as they appear 🎲  
3. **View the final count statistics** at the end 📋

## 🎯 Future Enhancements  
🔹 **Expand Tracked Sums** – Count all possible sums from 2 to 12 🔢  
🔹 **Graphical Representation** – Display results in a **bar chart** 📊  
🔹 **Interactive Mode** – Let users choose how many rolls to simulate 🎛️  
🔹 **Compare Against Theoretical Probabilities** – Show expected vs actual outcomes 📏
